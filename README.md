# Rough_try
A scratchpad for programming
This is my first time on github. I hope its going to be a wonderful experience and a awesome journey in programming.
I am an Electronics Engineer and a self taught programmer. I am looking forward to learning techniques to 
improve my algorithmic knowledge in machine learning and data science.
